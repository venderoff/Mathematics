## Sets was developed by German Mathematician "Georg Cantor".
```
∈ ---> can be written as ( Alt key + 8712)
```
```
Sets can be defined as Collection of distinct objects,
 called as elements or members considered as single entity.
```

### N : Natural numbers 
```
(The set of natural numbers consists of positive integers starting from 1 and going upwards without any end.)
```

### Z : Integers 
```
(Set of whole number which can be 0 , positive or negative whole numbers ex (-1,0,+1)
```

### Q : Rational Numbers (Set of number which can be depicted as Fraction a/b)

### Irrational Numbers: Numbers that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers. They have non-repeating, non-terminating decimal expansions. For example, √2 and 𝜋
π are irrational numbers. 

### R : Real numbers (Real numbers is a set which includers all possible numbers found in a number line.
(fractions and integers) as well as irrational numbers (which cannot be expressed as fractions).
```
Z+ : Positive Integers
Q+ : Positive Rational Numbers
R+ : Real Positive Numbers
```

# Subsets
```
It follows from the definition that every set A is a subset of itself, i.e., A ⊂ A. Since the empty
set ϕ has no elements, we agree to say that ϕ is a subset of every set.
